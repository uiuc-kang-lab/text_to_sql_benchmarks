[Task Description]
You have a SQLite database. Based on the Schema(with useful comments on columns), you generated plentiful question-query pairs with template, whose readability is terrible. Now, given a question-query pair, you are asked to rewrite the question to enhance its readability with the help of comments in Schema.

Q: {List the h_index and tag of the records ordered alphabetically by tag}
{SELECT Author.h_index , Researcher_Interests.tag FROM Author JOIN Researcher_Interests ON Author.id = Researcher_Interests.author_id ORDER BY Researcher_Interests.tag}
A: {i want to know h-index and research interest of every researcher, list them by tag in alphabetically order}

Q: {Report all information about records with h_index between 3 and 6 for which affiliation_name is M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.}
{SELECT * FROM Author JOIN Orgnization_Researchers ON Author.id = Orgnization_Researchers.author_id JOIN Affiliation ON Orgnization_Researchers.affiliation_name = Affiliation.DisplayName WHERE Author.h_index BETWEEN 3 AND 6 AND Orgnization_Researchers.affiliation_name = \"M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX\"}
A: {report all the researcher that belongs to 'M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.' and have a h-index between 3 and 6.}

Q: {please show the url of the Affiliation dataframe that have at least 7 records.}
{SELECT Affiliation.url FROM Affiliation GROUP BY Affiliation.url HAVING COUNT (*) >= 7}
A: {Find orgnizations who appered at least 7 times, and show me their homepage links.}

Q: {What are the DisplayName of records published before 1990?}
{SELECT Venue.DisplayName FROM Paper JOIN Venue_Papers ON Paper.id = Venue_Papers.paper_id JOIN Venue ON Venue_Papers.venue_id = Venue.id WHERE Paper.year < 1990}
A: {what are the names of venue that have papers published before 1990?}

Q: {Find n_citation and keyword of the top 3 n_citation.}
