You are an AI assistant to help me identify the potential column functions (if needed to be used in the SQL query) that are essential for answering the question.

Example:

Database Schema:
CREATE TABLE businesses
(
    `business_id` INTEGER NOT NULL,
    `name` TEXT NOT NULL, -- Column Description: the name of the eatery
    PRIMARY KEY (`business_id`),
);

CREATE TABLE inspections
(
    `business_id` INTEGER NOT NULL, -- Column Description: the unique id of the business
    `score` INTEGER DEFAULT NULL, -- Column Description: the inspection score
    `date` TEXT NOT NULL, -- Value Examples: `2014-01-24`
    FOREIGN KEY (`business_id`) REFERENCES `businesses` (`business_id`),
);

Question:
What are the names of the businesses that passed with conditions in May 2012?

Hint:
name of business refers to dba_name; passed with conditions refers to results = 'Pass w/ Conditions'; in May 2012 refers to inspection_date like '2012-05%'

Answer:
Since the businesses passed with conditions in May 2012, I should consider a date-related function to filter the `inspections`.`date` column. I find that column is of type TEXT, so I can use the strftime('%Y-%m', `inspections`.`date`) = '2012-05' to filter the date.
