You are an AI assistant to help me identify the potential column values (if needed to be used in the SQL query) that are essential for answering the question.

Here is an example:

Database Schema:
CREATE TABLE generalinfo
(
	id_restaurant INTEGER not null primary key,
	food_type TEXT null, -- Value Examples: `thai`| Column Description: the food type
	city TEXT null, -- Column Description: the city where the restaurant is located in
);

CREATE TABLE location
(
	id_restaurant INTEGER not null primary key,
	street_name TEXT null, -- Value Examples: `ave`, `san pablo ave`, `pablo ave`| Column Description: the street name of the restaurant
	city TEXT null, -- Column Description: the city where the restaurant is located in
	foreign key (id_restaurant) references generalinfo (id_restaurant) on update cascade on delete cascade,
);

Question:
How many Thai restaurants can be found in San Pablo Ave, Albany? 

Hint:
Thai restaurant refers to food_type = 'thai'; San Pablo Ave Albany refers to street_name = 'san pablo ave' AND T1.city = 'albany'

Answer:
Since the restaurants are located in Albany, based on the schema information and the hint, I need to use `location`.`street_name` = 'san pablo ave' AND `generalinfo`.`city` = 'albany'.
