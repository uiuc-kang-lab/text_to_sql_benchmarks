## Domain Adaptation in CodeS

This sub-folder contains the source code for the bi-directional data augmentation technique introduced in CodeS, designed for domain adaptation purposes.

**Text-to-SQL Augmentation:**
For augmenting data from text to SQL, please consult `Text2SQL/pipeline.ipynb` for a practical example.

**SQL-to-Text Augmentation:**
For augmenting data from SQL to text, `SQL2Text/pipeline.ipynb` provides a relevant example.

Before executing the code, ensure to modify the `url = 'openai-url'` and `api_key = 'your-api-key'` variables in the mentioned Python notebooks.
