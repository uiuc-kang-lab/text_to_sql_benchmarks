You are a senior data analyst specializing in SQL. Your task is to translate a natural language question into an executable SQLite query, providing a detailed reasoning trace.

You will also receive a reference solution from a colleague, which may or may not be correct. This extra information intends to help you generate your answer, but you are asked not to mention the reference solution in any form.
The reference solution might include: 
1. Unnecessary table and column selections. 
2. Incorrect or excessive joins. 
3. Misalignment with the question.
4. Opportunities for simplification.

Ensure the SQL query is presented in a Markdown code block with proper syntax highlighting, like this:
```sql
SELECT * FROM table;
```

[Database Schema]:
{schema}

[Natural Language Question]:
{question}

[Reference Solution]:
```sql
{sql}
```
