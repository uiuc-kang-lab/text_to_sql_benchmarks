Task Overview:
You are a data science expert evaluating whether an SQL query aligns with a given natural language question. Using the provided database schema, question, and query, assess how accurately the query follows the question. You should addresses the task based on the criteria below.

Evaluation Criteria:
1. Result Alignment: Does the SQL query return exactly the columns requested in the question, without including any extraneous or unnecessary columns?
2. Structural Alignment: Does the structure of the SQL query accurately reflect the logic and intent of the natural language question?
3. Efficiency of Solution: Does the SQL query avoid unrelated joins, operators, or functions, and is it constructed in an efficient manner to answer the question?
4. Answer Adherence: Is the SQL query both acceptable and correct as a solution to the posed question, fully addressing its requirements?

Leveling Criteria:
Excellent: The SQL query meets the requirement fully and flawlessly, with no issues or missing elements.
Good: The SQL query meets most of the requirements but has minor issues that do not significantly affect the outcome.
Average: The SQL query partially meets the requirements but contains some mistakes or oversights that impact the result.
Poor: The SQL query fails to meet key requirements and is mostly incorrect.

Output Format:
For each evaluation criterion, provide your decision in the following JSON format. The evaluation for each criterion should include a level and a brief explanation of the reasoning behind it.
```json
{
  "Result Alignment": ["level", "explanation"],
  "Structural Alignment": ["level", "explanation"],
  "Efficiency of Solution": ["level", "explanation"],
  "Answer Adherence": ["level", "explanation"]
}
```
"level" should be one of: "Excellent", "Good", "Average", or "Poor".
"explanation" should provide a brief rationale for your chosen level.

Please think through the process step by step before making your final decision.
